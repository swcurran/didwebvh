5. Priority: Ready to merge the spec change PR? [PR to clarify spec](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/282)

6. [Test Suite PR](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-test-suite) Progress
    - Discovered that the witness count failures were (mostly) in the test-suite code -- fixed.  TS still to be looked at.
    - The test harnesses had some "normalizations" that altered the library output to match the TS results.  Wrong!!  Removed.
    - Updated results after implementation releases (Rust, TS, Java, Java EECC)
    - Next Up:
        - Reviews of diffs to see what is OK or not.
            - Technique to make the diff process more flexible...
        - Remaining fails.
        - GitHub Actions for implementations to use the Test Suite
            - Tricky part -- what is "Pass"?
        - Controlling the input DIDDocs and DIDDoc updates (JSON Patch).

7. Presentation -- Explanding the VH Log to encompass "whois-vh"
    - Revisiting [Traversing the Web of Trust - 2018](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nYq0iakgtyC21oUGWa5hLuJUoKeJFpURtGz6HcLIltY/edit?usp=sharing) in 2026.

    - Decentralized trust hierarchies.

8. Test Suite Fails:

```bash=
implementations/dart/status.md:| witness-update | ts | ❌ FAIL | resolve error: Invalid witness proofs: insufficient witness proofs for entry 2-QmcRmyDP523pLsvKvr49BNEVsevhjNGYZhxMGtPyhut9Hy: need 2, got 1 |
implementations/python/status.md:| negative-versiontime-non-monotonic | invalidDid | ❌ FAIL | resolver accepted invalid log |
implementations/python/status.md:| negative-zero-witness-threshold | invalidParameters | ❌ FAIL | resolver accepted invalid log |
implementations/rust/status.md:| negative-pct-encoded-ip-host | invalidDid | ❌ FAIL | URL parser accepted invalid DID: did:webvh:Qm0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000:127%2E0%2E0%2E1 |
implementations/rust/status.md:| witness-update | ts | ❌ FAIL | resolve_log: WitnessProofError("Witness proof threshold (2) was not met. Only (1) proofs were validated") |

```
  - 2 Issues:
      - TS: Not enough witnesses on entry 2 of entry 2 (N/A for other libraries -- need to close the issues)
      - Python: negative tests
      - Rust: negative test

9. Next Version -- items:
    - Pre-rotation required.
    - PQC -- ML-DSA 44 (or other?)
        - Point to the currently being ratified for Data Integrity.
        - Cannot move back once changed to PQC.
    - Ensure non-normative items are clearly that.
    - Witnesses -- keys are hashes only.
        - Saves space when using PQC
        - When using did:key in a witness, do not need to have the full key in the fragment -- just use "vm" per the did:key spec.
    - versionNumber as a parameter -- add to spec
    - in-line witnesses
    - no domain DIDs

10. [PRs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pulls) to review

11. [Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues) to review

    4. Introductions and requests for additional Agenda Topics

2. Announcements:

    - Progress on the Test Suite -- negative tests, Docker-driven
    - Looking at did:webvh in the UNTP work. UNTP Publisher -- a regulatory body publishing UNTP credentials. Updated to v0.7 of UNTP. Being used by the Mining authority in British Columbia. Uses Data Integrity and VC-JOSE. Start with did:web for interop but parallel did:webvh identifier and showcase the features -- including /whois and Data Integrity.  Also a UNTP platform built on Veranamo. Building a Veranamo shim to use did:webvh...meeting with them today.

3. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS] -- Universal resolver not updated
    2. [Credo-TS] -- Need a new release to use 2.7.5 of TS. New PRs from Digital Catapult (Robert Learney) using Credo-TS and Data Integrity. Separating out things like Attested Resources. Good stuff -- new eyes, different perspective on the implementation.
    3. [Python] -- TS interop PR merged.
    4. [Rust] -- New release, Issue added about witness DID
    5. [Server-Py] -- 
    6. [Watcher-Py] -- 
    7. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] -- 
    8. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin] -- 
    9. [Test Suite] -- Docker added, negative tests, updated to latest.
    10. [did:webvh Tutorial] -- 
    11. [Implementations] -- 

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. DONE Stephen: Update the test suite to reference the new EECC Java implementation updates and update the status of those tests.
    2. Stephen: Update the DIF Universal Resolver to use the latest TS version.
    3. OBE Stephen: Raise and file issues in the relevant repositories regarding the incorrect handling of witnesses in the "Witness Update" test and other identified spec compliance issues.
    4. Stephen: Extend the "Witness Update" test script to include a third entry that does not change the witnesses, to better test witness handling and pruning.
    5. Stephen: Check with other implementations to see if they allow passing an initial DID document as input, and consider updating the test suite to use an initial identical DID document for all implementations, with JSON patch updates for changes.
    6. Patrick: Update the credo-ts release to reference version 2.7.5.
    7. DONE Stephen: Continue to raise issues in the specs and work towards clarifications on version 1, and start drafting the next version of the spec.
    11. DONE Patrick: Review and, if appropriate, merge the PR for the restructured test suite.
    12. IN PROGRESS Stephen: Continue to look for ways to automate the test suite process in the future.

5. [Test Suite PR](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-test-suite)
    - Added Negative Tests after Mythos testing
    - Updated results after implementation releases (Rust, TS, Java, Java EECC)
    - Next Up:
        - Reviews of implementation status.
        - Controlling the input DIDDocs and DIDDoc updates (JSON Patch).

6. Main Topic -- [PR to clarify spec](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/282) after Mythos assessment. Summary of changes to discuss.
    1. Security -- [Resolver Transport Hardening](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/282/changes#diff-cacee5d8aa2745080c92d73c31d0e634fc9818cbce5ba7c0cc10149ff6d1111cR89)
    2. Security -- Resolver security checklist
    3. Privacy -- General guidance
    4. [Percent encoding rules](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/282/changes#diff-201be5aaa4db892f64a3e963f003b11e294f89f6e4fb06435dbec6307cdf7e07R87) -- basically -- validate the DID **after** percent encoding.
    5. List of types of non-compliant entries that are implied in the spec, but that might be missed.
    6. FIX: Selectively replace "{SCID}" in the DIDDoc vs. all instances. Back and forth on that.
    7. [Process the log](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/282/changes#diff-201be5aaa4db892f64a3e963f003b11e294f89f6e4fb06435dbec6307cdf7e07R376) as defined in the spec -- no short cuts!!  No really, we mean it.
    8. Stronger language around the calculation of `versionId`/`versionTime`.
    9. DIDDoc verifications -- `id` is DID, `id` must have SCID, `id` must match DID in at least one version (to account for moved DIDs).
    10. [Stronger wording around pre-rotation handling](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/282/changes#diff-201be5aaa4db892f64a3e963f003b11e294f89f6e4fb06435dbec6307cdf7e07R421).
    11. [SCID must match](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/282/changes#diff-201be5aaa4db892f64a3e963f003b11e294f89f6e4fb06435dbec6307cdf7e07R509) at least one entry -- wrong! Must match all entries!!!
    12. [`method` MUST match](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/282/changes#diff-201be5aaa4db892f64a3e963f003b11e294f89f6e4fb06435dbec6307cdf7e07R671) one of a published specification and non-listed values rejected.
    13. Must use the algorithms implied by the `method` value (e.g. SHA-256 and eddsa-jcs-2022).
    14. Expand on the need for both updateKeys and nextKeyHashes in every entry with pre-rotation active.
    15. Resolvers reject `portable` setting in entries later than 1st.
    16. Repeat of replacement of "{SCID}" with `<scid>` in the Entry.
    17. Additional details on the Data Integrity Proof (repeats `method` information).
    18. More words to say that `portable` must be present and `true` in the first entry, and the SCID must not change after a DID renaming/move.
    19. Reiterating that the did:key DID URL must follow did:key rules (DID identifier and fragment must be the same).
    20. Expanded specification of threshold and meeting the threshold.
    21. Limit the did:key to be an Ed25519 key.  Is this new? No -- the key must be used in an eddsa-jcs-2022 proof.
    22. Don't count multiple proofs from one witness as more than one towards the threshold.
    23. [Where the did-witness.json file must come from](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/282/changes#diff-201be5aaa4db892f64a3e963f003b11e294f89f6e4fb06435dbec6307cdf7e07R1109).  I don't think it matters where it comes from as long as the proofs are valid and the thresholds are met.
    24. Proof and did:key handling -- no external reference to a key.
    25. Re-enforce that witness verification is full verification.  Aside -- not sure that is needed if the witness is oblivious...
    26. Restatement of the witnessing rules with a warning about the "possibility" of pulling a witness proof from another DID witness file.  That's impossible.
    27. Another restatement of the witness processing rules -- especially ignoring proofs that are from the same did:key.

1. Stephen: Update the test suite to reference the new EECC Java implementation updates and update the status of those tests.
2. Stephen: Update the DIF Universal Resolver to use the latest TS version.
3. Stephen: Raise and file issues in the relevant repositories regarding the incorrect handling of witnesses in the "Witness Update" test and other identified spec compliance issues.
4. Stephen: Extend the "Witness Update" test script to include a third entry that does not change the witnesses, to better test witness handling and pruning.
5. Stephen: Check with other implementations to see if they allow passing an initial DID document as input, and consider updating the test suite to use an initial identical DID document for all implementations, with JSON patch updates for changes.
6. Patrick: Update the credo-ts release to reference version 2.7.5.
7. Stephen: Continue to raise issues in the specs and work towards clarifications on version 1, and start drafting the next version of the spec.
11. Patrick: Review and, if appropriate, merge the PR for the restructured test suite.
12. Stephen: Continue to look for ways to automate the test suite process in the future.

5. [Test Suite PR](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-test-suite/pull/4)
    - Added EECC Java implementation
    - Restructured:
        - All implementations generate output (logs, resolution results)
        - All implementations resolve all logs of other implementations
        - status.md and diff.txt output per implementation
            - PASS/FAIL/SKIP/XFAIL status for all generate and resolve tests
            - diff between the native and implementation resolution result
    - Additional changes:
        - Add initial DIDDoc and updates to reduce diffs
        - Review the "XFAIL" handling.
        - Look for ways to automate the process
        - More issues raised in implementations

6. Issues from Test Suite:
    - Rust: not using did:key in the `witnesses` array
    - All but Rust: Not enough witnesses in the witness update test
        - Entry 1: two witnesses
        - Entry 2: one witness -- but should be witnessed by 2 from Entry 1
        - Probably should update the test to have a third Entry -- witnessed by 1, and to see the pruning done
    - Python/Rust: not handling the TS `"nextKeyUpdates: []"` usage -- which is valid
    - Java -- Null pointer exception, not inserting implicit services
    - Diffs
        - Inconsistent metadata

7. Next Version -- items.
    - Pre-rotation required.
    - PQC -- ML-DSA 44
        - Point to the currently being ratified for Data Integrity.
        - Cannot move back once changed to PQC.
    - Ensure non-normative items are clearly that.
    - Witnesses -- keys are hashes only.
        - Saves space when using PQC
        - When using did:key in a witness, do not need to have the full key in the fragment -- just use "vm" per the did:key spec.
    - versionNumber as a parameter -- add to spec
    - in-line witnesses
    - no domain DIDs

7. [PRs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pulls) to review

8. [Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues) to review

9. Open Discussion -- what else do you want to discuss?

3. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS] -- bug fixes -- one particularly bad. Need a release.
    2. [Credo-TS] -- needs to get updated with latest TS
    3. [Python] -- a couple of fixes needed from the compliance test suite runs
    4. [Rust] --  a couple of fixes needed from the compliance test suite runs

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. DONE Stephen: Merge the "denial of service security considerations" PR into the specification.
    2. NOPE Stephen: Reach out regarding high assurance DIDs with DNS and updating the relevant spec.
    3. NOPE Stephen: Review and potentially update the threat modeling document before sharing it more widely.
    4. NOPE Stephen (and/or Patrick): Draft a simplified log format spec (VH Log) that can be used for managing resources other than DID documents (e.g., /whois-vh), and consider how operations like create, update, deactivate, and versioning should be handled.

5. [didwebvh-ts/issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-ts/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-ts/pulls).

6. [Test Suite PR](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-test-suite/pull/4)
    - Features:
        - DSL for generating DIDs
        - Known good results
        - 13 tests -- happy path
            - TBD: Corrupt test steps for creating bad DID Logs.
        - Drivers for TS (source of good results), Python, Rust
        - Issues between TS and Python and between TS and Rust.
            - Need to try other combinations -- what does TS do with Python/Rust DIDs?
    - Plan:
        - Decide on discrepancies between implementations. Issues:
            - updateKeyHashes value "[]"
        - Move per implementation drivers into the implementation repos to use with GHActions.
    - Patrick's new compliance app.

7. Removing options to make things required.
    - Generating:
        - Pre-rotation -- leaning is to require
            - NOTE: If we go to this, updateKeys could go away. Considering having `updateKeys` being just a hash (for PQC key size reasons), but if pre-rotation is required, it is not needed at all -- just verify that the key in the proof is in the `nextKeyHashes`. Better yet, use the name `preRotationKeys` for the list of hashes.
        - Witnesses -- leave as is
            - NOTE: Change the keys to be key hashes for PQC size improvement.
        - Watchers -- leave as is
        - TTL -- leave as is
        - Portability -- leave as is
        - Explicit whois/files services in DIDDoc -- leave as is
        - updateKeys to [] on deactivate -- leave as is
        - decoy entries in updateKeys/nextKeyHashes -- non-normative
        - Parallel did:web -- non-normative
        - SCID in HTTP path -- non-normative
        - updateKeys in DIDDoc -- non-normative
    - Resolving:
        - versionNumber has parameter -- add to spec
        - DID URL Resolution
        - Caching policies
        - Alternative sources on NotFound -- non-normative
        - Pruning witnesses
        - Providing problem details

8. PQC Testing
    - Pretty easy implementation (via Claude)
    - Used ML-DSA 44 -- NIST equivalent to EDDSA.
    - Interesting result:

   - Discussion with JC about DID Linked VP -- perhaps the same, but probably better handled at a different level.
   - Manifest /whois
   - Use the same technique we are using with did:webvh and did:web -- have /whois that is derived from /whois-vh.
   - Another effort -- extract the Log Format as its own spec and then use it for both did:webvh and /whois-vh
       - SCID generation? Should be the same.
       - Method handling -- at the Log Spec level or at the specs that use the Log level.
       - Task: How would the did:webvh spec change?
   - What about the `webfinger` approach? Need to see what it does and how it could work with /whois.

    2. Please make sure you: [join DIF], [sign the WG Charter], and follow the [DIF Code of Conduct]. Questions? Please contact [operations@identity.foundation].
    3. [did:webvh Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and requests for additional Agenda Topics

2. Announcements:

    - Update to the did:webvh [Rust] implementation (v0.3.0). Major changes:
        1. Now supports external signers so that the code never sees secret key material
        2. Developer convenience functions to help with witnesses
        3. Improved error messages to be more instructive on failures
        4. Refactored code to allow removing regex requirements, reqwest (HTTP client) is now gated behind a feature flag
        5. More tests, integration tests with mock server to better emulate network tests and failures.

        - A lot of the changes are based on security reviews and audits, along
        with production deployment insights/reviews/requests. Hence the ability
        to now easily integrate with Key management Services (KMS) or Hardware
        Security Modules (HSM's) to meet security policies and regulated
        environments. 

3. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS] -- 
    2. [Credo-TS] -- 
    3. [Python] -- 
    4. [Rust] -- See notes above -- a big deal!
    5. [Server-Py] -- did:webvh server Helm Chart are now in the DIF [Helm Charts](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/helm-charts) repo. Would like to do more on /whois. Discussion in UNTP about if a DIA should be just a VC vs. a /whois like VP with the embedded VC.
    6. [Watcher-Py] -- 
    7. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] -- 
    8. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin] -- Migration scripts to support those upgrading issuers to did:webvh.
    9. [Test Suite] -- 
    10. [did:webvh Tutorial] -- 
    11. [Implementations] -- 

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. Stephen: Follow up on adding an issue for inlining witness proofs and other pending to-dos.
    2. DONE Stephen: Add Issue about getting did:webvh into the DID Resolution Test Suite in the relevant repository.
    3. DONE Stephen: Investigate JSON Text Sequences RFC and content negotiation options for log formats, as suggested by Benjamin.

5. [DOS Security considerations PR](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/276).
    1. Sub-issue -- the 1 second interval between versions.

6. did:webvh Threat Modelling Document

7. Adding a DNS record to bind the domain to a DIDDoc when using a .well-known DID.
    1. From the [High Assurance DIDs with DNS Spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-carter-high-assurance-dids-with-dns/)
        - Recommend adding a `dnsValidationDomain` to the DIDDoc -- `{"dnsValidationDomain": "example.ca"}` per section 3.2.1.  Or is that unnecessary, given the domain is in the DID?
            - What about the `controller` DIDDoc attribute for authorization of DID updates -- e.g. putting the domain into that?
            - How do you model a group of entities (e.g. people) that control a DID?
        - Recommend adding a DNS record for to link to the did:webvh DID -- e.g. `_did.example-issuer.ca IN URI 1 0 “did:webvh:<scid>.example-issuer.ca` per section 3.3
        - Consider adding what to do for domain-less or domain+path did:webvh DIDs.
        - I don't think we should mention adding verificationMethods via TLSA records. IMHO - bad idea.

8. Retaining and accessing historical `<did>/whois` VPs.
    - Query parameters for access -- e.g. `?whoisTime=<time>` and/or perhaps `?versionTime=<time>`
    - Data format?
        - whois.jsonl perhaps
            - Juan -- time travel dereferencing should align getting back the DIDDoc and the whois.vp at the time requested.
            - Complication -- what if the whois service entry changes across updates.  That gives us three different times:
                - Where the whois history today?  Current DIDDoc
                    - Can we require that the whois history be found relative to the DID Log? Argument against is that we want /whois to work with all DIDs -- including domainless did:webvh DIDs.
                - What was the whois at the time requested.
                - What was the DIDDoc at the time requested to be able to verify the whois.vp.
        - Have the array of VCs include the historical ones
            - Tricky if there is no expiry in the "previous one"
    - Is this part of the /whois spec or the Linked-VP spec? Don't need to specify how it is implemented, just what needs to be returned.
    - Can the verifier get the full history, or just a single Linked-VP?
    - How does this relate to a Watcher? It could have the historical /whois and could still serve tha

    3. NOT DONE Stephen: Go through Patrick's scenario document and add more notes.

    5. DONE? Group (implied Stephen/Patrick/Dmitri): In next version discussions, evaluate and document pros and cons of different approaches for handling key revocation and accumulation of valid keys in DIDWebVH, including responsibilities between resolver and client.
    6. Group: Review DIDCore's handling of revoked keys and consider its applicability to DIDWebVH.

5. Discussion -- PQ support in did:webvh
    - Connection with merging witness proofs into DID Log. Moderate savings to have separate log today, but massive savings when done with PQ keys, where public keys, signatures will dominate the log.
        - Idea from Glenn Gore/[Affinidi]
          - Add a new entry type -- Witness Entry
          - Format (?) `{ "versionId": "<id>", "proof" : [] }`
          - When processing -- if witnesses are not in log, retrieve external source
      - Less important, but perhaps of interest. For `updateKeys` and `witness id` public keys/dids -- use hash in the parameters. The key/did has to be in the proof, so a hash is enough of a commitment to determine that the right key is being used for the proof. See [example log](https://didwebvh.info/latest/example/#data-integrity-proof-generation-and-first-log-entry).
  - Don't just rely on the "method" parameter, but also have a parameter that says "pq" to indicate the change to PQ.
  - PQ makes irrelevant that we are using JSON. No benefit to use CBOR or other compression techniques.

5. Discussion -- Optimizing Space Required For Inactive Keys

- Keys are added in DID Versions -- added to `state` -- for signing, encryption
- Keys are rotated -- current key becomes `inactive`
    - Need to convoy not used for signing (and when stopped), but OK for verification
- Keys are found to be compromised and are revoked
    - Need to convey that a key has been compromised and should NOT be used for verification
- Current approach -- DID Standard
    - Inactive keys remain in current DIDDocument
    - Revoked keys are removed from the current DIDDocument
- But...we have the full history -- why keep repeating the same key over and over
- Idea that keys are only put into the DID Log once
    - Revoked keys are revoked via a parameter -- probably needed regardless so metadata can be generated.
    - DIDDoc is compromised of current `state` PLUS an entry for each inactive key at the time of the version.
- Thoughts?
    - How is the `#<fragment>` for each key defined?
    - How are aliases for each key defined?
    - Too complicated?
    - Worth the savings?

6. Continuing the did:webvh and did:cel Discussion

- For v2, we need to at least change the implict services defined by did:webvh. What else?
- Heartbeats -- easy -- parameter. Should we also make the `state` optional to optimize space efficiency when using mostly heartbeats. If missing, the previous `state` value still applies. Other than that -- each heartbeat is just a version.
- Witnesses -- issues -- separate, culled file vs. inline. Let's revisit that...
    - Recall the performance test that Glenn Gore did -- [details are here](https://didwebvh.info/latest/faq/WitnessFile/)
        - Total (Log + Witness) size is doubled, retrieval takes longer, processing takes longer.
- Making the domain part of the DID optional.
    - Patrick has ideas to share!
    - Detach the DID from the Domain -- same rules as portability.
        - Also allows attaching the DID to a new domain.
    - Moves did:webvh to align with did:scid
        - Demostration: use did:scid -- no location and published on Hedera
        - Example DID that use the did:webvh Log and storage is on Hedera: `did:scid:vh:1:QmfGEUAcMpzo25kF2Rhn8L5FAXysfGnkzjwdKoNPi615XQ?src=hedera:testnet:0.0.1001`
- The log format -- any changes?
    - Consolidating witness proofs and log, would help with `location-less` dids.
- What are the optional things the did:cel crowd might not like?
    - List of things that are optional in `did:webvh`:
        - Domain component (if we decide to make it optional).
        - DID Portability (changing domain component, keeping SCID and history).
            - Challenging when DIDs can move and then a new one created with the same domain.
            - Two SCIDs and one ported, the other remaining.
            - To confirm: a ported DID has the alsoKnownAs with the old DID.
        - DID Spec Version (allows changing cryptographic algorithms mid-log).
        - Prerotation
            - Was this part of the list?
        - Witnesses
            - Oblivious witnessing
        - Watchers
            - Where they are (comparable to the did:cel data element)
            - The Watchers API -- webhooks, reads, removals
        - Mechanical translation from did:webvh to did:web

- Nothing relevant to cover here.

5. did:webvh and did:cel Discussion

- Manu Sporny: A briefing on [did:cel](https://digitalbazaar.github.io/did-cel-spec/) -- key features, design goals. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MlldyytklkYoPwPP47SuFZNsfNMeEFTM2fnmaEIYiD4/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)
- did:cel features in did:webvh
    - heartbeat -- 2 parts: commitment to timely updates, optimizing log size
        - Add an element to the `parameters` object: `"heartbeat": "P30D"` -- uses the [ISO 8601 Duration Format](https://docs.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm), any DID that has versions with versionTime longer than the "heartbeat" commitment, or where the last `versionTime` is more `heartbeat` from `now()` fails verification.
        - Consider optimizing the log size where there is a high expectation that there will be many more heartbeat entries than updates. In that case, the only optimization I would suggest is make `state` optional, and when left out, the previous value remains in effect. The rest of the log entries are necessary, so keeping them is necessary.
    - oblivious witnesses -- no change to functionality, just a change to first three steps of the process of [Witnessing a DID Version Update](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/v1.0/#witnessing-a-did-version-update) to remove the requirement that a witness verify a DID before witnessing it. A witness need only receive the `versionId` of the new version, "approve" it (ecosystem dependent governance) and return a proof.
    - A SCID-only did:webvh DID -- our ongoing discussion.
        - As previously noted, a relatively small change to the specification -- changing the wording from "here is where you get the log" to "you must get the log via one of these ways" and including the URL component of the DID, the query parameter, a watcher or "you just know".
        - Use cases?
- The Desirability (or not) of Optional Features in did:webvh
    - List:
        - Domain component (if we decide to make it optional).
        - DID Portability (changing domain component, keeping SCID and history).
        - DID Spec Version (allows changing cryptographic algorithms mid-log).

        - The log format
        - Separate keys -- log vs. DID
