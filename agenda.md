7. DID URL Path Resolution -- want to talk about it? Yes!
    - Fragments -- handle the same as HTTP -- client deals with the resolved resource and content type.
    - Path -- `<did>/path/to/resource`
      - left to each DID method
      - Goal: Path resolved through a storage system mechanism
      - High level approach -- look in the services section -- under the appropriate types use that as the base.
      - Cascading fallback algo:
          - Use Cases:
              - One storage service -- one path `<serviceEndpoint>/path/to/file`
          - What if there are multiple?
              - Current -- use a query parameter to point to a specific service. `service='<id?'`
              - Could we use a `prefix` notation? Use the path to determine the right service, and the type of the service to define the serviceEndpoint handling.
                  - `prefix`: '<did>/googledrive/path/to/file'
                  - `prefix`: '/dropbox/'
          - The `whois` use case doesn't work with the above.  Instead, what about a query parameter `/whois`?
              - Could we use the matches on prefix and service type?
    
**Redirection Algorithm for DID URL Paths**

Given a DID URL of the form <did>/path/to/file, perform the following steps to resolve it to a target resource via service redirection:

1.  **Extract the Path** 
    
    Extract the _path_ component from the DID URL (e.g., /path/to/file).
    
2.  **Identify Matching Services** 
    
    From the DID Document, find all services that include a prefix property. For each such service:
    
    -   Check if the DID URL path starts with the service’s prefix value.
    -   Keep all services where this is true.

3.  **Select the Best Match** 
    
    From the matching services:
    
    -   Select the service with the **longest matching prefix** (i.e., the most specific match).        
    
4.  **Construct the Redirect URL** 
    
    -   Remove the matching prefix from the start of the DID URL path.
        
    -   Append the remainder to the serviceEndpoint of the selected service, ensuring appropriate URL concatenation.
    
    - Question: Should we allow for service `type` specific processing in assembling/resolving the `serviceEndpoint`.
        
    
5.  **Resolve the Target** 
    
    -   Resolve the resulting URL.
        
    -   Return the resolved resource and associated metadata.
        

---

**Notes:**

-   Matching is literal, case-sensitive, and must be prefix-based (e.g., /docs matches /docs/file.txt but not /documents/file.txt).
    
-   If no service matches, the DID URL is not redirected and may resolve to the DID Document or be treated as an error.
    
-   This algorithm assumes the serviceEndpoint is an HTTP(S) URL or another resolvable resource reference.

```json
services: [
  { 
      id: '...',
      type: 'FileService',
      prefix: '/',
      serviceEndpoint: 'https://my.storage.example/files/'
   }
]

```

For `<did>/whois`, the prefix matches the entire path, so an empty string is appended to the serviceEndpoint, so the serviceEndpoint is the full URL of the verifiable presentation.

```json
services: [
  {
     id: 'my-whois-service',
     prefix: '/whois',
     type: 'WhoisService',
     serviceEndpoint: 'https://server/path/to/whois.vp'
  }
]
```

    1. DONE Stephen to merge the PR about deactivation after addressing Brian's comment about empty objects.
    2. NOT DONE Stephen to raise issues in the DID WebVH spec and DID resolution spec regarding deactivation behavior and version parameters.
    3. DONE Stephen to prepare for the Open Wallet Foundation presentation on Monday, September 15th.

5. [PRs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pulls) Review
    - Discuss and merge if possible.

6. Other [Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues) Review
    - Discuss and close as possible.
    - Notes...

7. Question from Tim Bloomfield about [Oblivious HTTP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9458.html) -- is there something we could do in the spec or implementation tools to enable support.

`<tl;dr>` Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) is standardized and minimized TOR-like capability where a Client sends a request to a Server through an OHTTP Relay to a Gateway, and gets the response back along the reverse path. Neither the Gateway nor the Server learn who sent the request, and the Relay doesn't know where the request went. The request/response are encrypted using TLS between the client and server -- hidden from the Relay and Gateway.

In practice, OHTTP is used for sessionless queries, such as for the Google Safe Browsing List and Firefox's Browser Telemetry data collection. A did:webvh server or watchers are good candidates for this capability.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client (Wallet / Resolver / Verifier)
    participant Relay as OHTTP Relay (e.g., Fastly)
    participant Gateway as OHTTP Gateway (Ecosystem-Operated)
    participant Server as did:webvh Server / Watcher

    Client->>Relay: Encapsulated OHTTP Request<br/>(encrypted with Gateway’s key)
    Relay->>Gateway: Forward opaque blob
    Gateway->>Server: Decapsulated HTTP Request<br/>(to did:webvh server or watcher)
    Server-->>Gateway: HTTP Response
    Gateway-->>Relay: Encapsulated OHTTP Response
    Relay-->>Client: Forward opaque blob (encrypted response)

    note over Relay,Gateway: Relay sees client IP but not content.<br/>Gateway sees content but not client IP.
```

Discuss...
* Good idea -- could be in the privacy section as a mitigation -- guidance.
* Relevant more to the implementations -- try testing it out and see about how this works.  Could be done in resolvers so we can see the speed/privacy tradeoff.

8. Open Discussion -- what else do you want to discuss?

    2. [Python] -- 
    3. [Rust] -- See notes above about 0.1.6.

    1. DONE - The group to present about DID WebVH and DID Attested Resources at the Open Wallet Foundation's Wallet Interoperability SIG meeting on September 15th.
    2. SCHEDULED for 2026.02.17 (!!) - The group to prepare a presentation for the CCG about WebVH, attested resources, and the topic of default service in DIDs.
    3. Patrick to explore making the witness file a service in the DID WebVH specification.
    4. DONE - Stephen to review Glenn's comments on the deactivate session pull request.
    5. Stephen to consider potential unwanted effects of portability on the deactivation methods.
    6. Patrick to try implementing verification of credentials with past rotated keys in ACA-Py to test if it works with query parameters -- e.g. a DID of the form `<did>?versionId=<id>#keyid`.

5. Question from Glenn about the definition in the did:webvh spec about the `/whois` service. Is it valid that the `id` is a relative ref (just `#whois`) or does it need to be `<did>#whois`? The DID Core Spec clearly supports this -- see [Relative DID URLs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did/upcoming/#relative-did-urls) section. But what about interop?
    - We can add to the spec "may use an absolute reference" to the implict definitions of the two services.

6. [PRs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pulls) Review
    - Discuss and merge if possible.

    - Notes...

8. Open Discussion -- what else do you want to discuss?

    3. [Rust] -- Updated with recent feedback to the wizard and clarifications.
    4. [Server-Py] -- Deployed the BC Gov Sandbox of the Server-Py. Anyone can use it for test DIDs.
    5. [Watcher-Py] -- 
    6. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] -- 
    7. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin] --

    9. [did:webvh Tutorial] -- 
    10. [Implementations] -- 

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. DONE - Brian to complete Patrick's PR for both the 06 and 05 branches
    2. DONE - Patrick to open the PR for Python 1.0 release with null parameter changes this afternoon
    3. DONE - Patrick to ping Andrew for review on the Python PR
    4. IN PROGRESS - Andrew to review the Askar Issue -- request for a new version
    5. DONE - Stephen to add a note in the security section about avoiding reuse of update keys

5. New spec -- [DID Attested Resources] ([DID Attested Resources Repository]) has been created at DIF and we'll start to circulate it. Once it is close enough, we'll update the [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] to reference the new spec instead of embedding it. Feedback welcome.

    - Question from Dmitri -- how does did:webvh only use a path on the DID using `relativeRef` without including a query parameter that references the (implicit or explicit) service.  Stephen to add a DID Resolution issue to request that there is **one** way to define the base of a DID URL. We should have a session with the CCG/DID Working Group on this topic.
    - Patrick would like to remove "DID" from the name as it is able to be used with DIDs and other controlled identifiers.

6. The concept of a "location-less" `did:webvh` (from chat on Signal) -- making the server location optional, and if not provided, the resolver (or client of the resolver) is assumed to know from context (e.g. outside the specification -- left to governance) where to find the DID Log and witness files. This is an alternate to did:scid, mostly because I don't understand did:scid, and why it is better than achieving the same goals with just `did:webvh`.

Potential uses:

- An alternative to did:peer for peer DIDs. Requires that the distribution of the DID Log by handle.
- Useful as a replacement for did:plc, where the location of the DIDs are "known" and accessed via an API.
- An ecosystem with well known watchers.
- Location can be in a query parameter, e.g. `<did>?src=<DID Log URL>` 

ASIDE: Dmitri/Patrick super clever idea -- make the "witness.json" referenced by a service in the DIDDoc. An implicit service that you can override. Issue to be added to the `did:webvh` repo. Issue to be added to the spec for a future version.

A suggestion was made that this might be a separate spec / DID Method because it would change a lot in the spec. However, I would argue the reverse -- that it would change very little in the spec, and separating it out would duplicate almost the entire spec. The only thing we are changing is the removal of the "discovery" method for the spec, and adding a note -- if there is no location in the spec, it is up to the resolver to know where to get the DID Log File, which is out of scope of the spec.  We might add the query parameter method as an alternative. 

7. [PRs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pulls) Review
    - Discuss and merge if possible.
    - Re: [Deactivation PR 252](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/252)
        - Still need to review more Glenn's comments, but they are more at the DID Resolution level than at the DID Method level. Patrick mentioned about how partability might impact deactivation.
        - This led to an interesting discussion about the need to differentiate between why a key has been detactivated -- rotation but signatures valid vs. compromised -- don't trust, and making it easier to directly find past keys with status metadata without having to include them in the current DIDDoc. Issue to be added to the did:webvh spec and to be raised at the DID Resolution level.

8. NOT COVERED - OUT OF TIME: Other [Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues) Review
    - Discuss and close as possible.

5. [PRs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pulls) Review
    1. Discuss and merge if possible.
    2. PRs merged, except the security and privacy one (new). More changes pending on that after the meeting.

6. Question from Victor Dods. If there is more than one entry in the `updateKeys` what happens if you have two keys used to make different parallel updates to the DID? (From this [issue comment](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/pull/67#issuecomment-3177377431)).
    1. Separate out the two cases of malicious vs. accidental.
        1. Accidental. Mitigations:
            1. did:webvh server could detect and prevent.
            2. did:webvh witnesses would detect and prevent.
            3. did:webvh watchers would detect and prevent.
        2. Malicious.
            1. Loss of key -- mitigation is the use of pre-rotation.
            2. All of the other mitigations apply, but in a different way -- detecting an invalid update.

7. Question from Victor Dods as [issue #246](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/246) explicitly address in the spec that a DID Controller should not reuse an update / pre-rotation key.
    1. Discussed and agreed we should add a note recommending against doing so in line with key handling best practices, but there is not a requirement for the resolver to track/detect/invalidate the DID if that is done. A resolver can do that, but not required.

8. Other [Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues) Review
    1. Issues reviewed, some closed based on the PRs merged earlier in the meeting.

9. Open Discussion -- what else do you want to discuss?

3. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS] -- updates made to align with others.
    2. [Python] -- No updates -- interop and performance tests run.
    3. [Rust] -- No updates
    4. [Affinidi Rust] -- updates, interop testing, performance testing.

    7. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] -- 
    8. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin] -- policy implementation to match the server. DIDComm protocols for the witnessing -- both for log entries and for attested resources (initial use -- AnonCreds objects). Works with the ACA-Py Endorser Server repository at OWF. Allows control/governance over what can be published by a given instance of ACA-Py. Iterations of how to handle this -- now at a good place, including auto-approval and approval.
    9. [Test Suite] -- 
    10. [did:webvh Tutorial] -- 
    11. [Implementations] -- repo added, populated with initial implementations.

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. [PR 233](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/233) DONE - Stephen to update the did:webvh specification with clearer guidelines on optional parameters and default values.
    2. DONE - Stephen to add the witness proof file analysis to the [FAQ section](https://didwebvh.info/latest/faq/) of the specification.
    3. DONE? - Glenn to make the performance testing code available for other implementations to use.
    4. DONE - Stephen to monitor and participate in discussions about DID method standardization at W3C.
    5. IN PROGRESS - Stephen to submit PRs for the pending issues listed in the specification repository.
    6. DONE Stephen to create a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348111717639344128/) announcing the release of ACA-Py 1.3.1 with did:webvh support.

5. Continued from last meeting, but with a concrete PR in place about what should be in the spec when describing optional parameters.
    1. Big question -- is this a new version, or leave it as 1.0?
       1. Decision -- leave it as 1.0. The added deprecation/resolver guidance in the PR will allow us to justify that.

6. New issues from implementation iterations:
    1. [\#235](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/235) -- Method can only increase -- agreed
    2. [\#236](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/236) -- Clarifying resolver witness proof handling requirements -- agreement, PR to be added.
    3. [\#234](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/234) -- Verifiable history of resources. Agreed that while this is interesting, it is not likely did:webvh specific. Could be a separate spec, or perhaps added in a later did:webvh version.
    4. Other PRs and Issues. Looked at the did:web one and almost ready -- Stephen has since added an update to deal with the `/whois` with a parallel DID.

7. The [Implementations] repo -- an overview from Patrick St. Louis.

8. Open Discussion -- what else do you want to discuss?

1. Welcome and Adminstrivia
    1. Recording on?

    3. [did:webvh Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and requests for additional Agenda Topics

2. Announcements:
    1. Affinidi performance testing results.
        - 10 years of monthly DID updates -- 120 log entries.
        - Periodic witness and watcher updates
        - 197kb Log, 5.9kb witness file
        - 50ms to generate the log
        - 28ms to verify the log
        - "This is a very good performance result compared to other high-trust traceable DIDs (Keri, BlockChain). I can validate ~10 years of WebVH history in under 30ms, faster than likely fetching a web3 DID ;)"
    2. New: did:webvh implementations (TS, PY) pass the DID Test Suite ([link](https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/#M51)).
      - Had to tweak the DID resolution document metadata for `threshold`, converting it a string when resolving -- still an integer in the Log Entry.

4. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS] -- working through change requests from Credo Team. Dealing with two version of Credo. Update for the `threshold` metadata.
    2. [Python] -- 
    3. [Rust] -- 
    4. [Server-Py] -- Policy features nearing completion.
    5. [Watcher-Py] -- 
    6. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] -- 
    7. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin] -- Updated for ACA-Py 1.3.1 -- now deployable on a released version of ACA-Py.
    8. [Test Suite] -- 
    9. [did:webvh Tutorial] -- Updated for v1.0 spec.

5. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. Stephen to update the tutorial page on the web info site with Affinidi's tutorial details.
    2. DONE - Stephen to pursue clarification on witness handling with Glenn from Affinidi, based on Patrick's input.
    3. DONE - Stephen to add an issue and PR for adding service endpoints to the did:web equivalent of did:webvh.
    4. DONE - Stephen to add a note about including "also known as" references in both did:webvh and did:web documents.
    5. Patrick to update the tutorial to include service endpoints in the did:web example.
    6. IN PROGRESS - BC Gov team to continue work on implementing a production-level did:webvh system with policy enforcement mechanisms.
    7. IN PROGRESS - Patrick to continue development of the did:webvh server with configurable policy enforcement features.
    8. IN PROGRESS - Patrick to develop the endorser service as a plugin for supporting did:webvh in Traction.

8. Discussion on what should be in the spec when describing optional parameters.  How do we get the wording right to remove ambiguity?

   - Need developer input to get the wording right.
   
   - It gets tricky for the first entry (requires defaulting to some value) vs. later entries (previous value holds).
   
   - In future, when a DID changes the spec it is using, that may result in new parameters needing to be defaulted if not explicitly specified.
       - Changelog contents -- must include what new parameters and their defaults?
   
   - Must have a way to explictly turn off a value -- so include it but set it to the default -- not `null`.
   
   - Need to handle these issues:
       - Array -- "[]"
       - Dict -- "{}"
       - Strings -- "".
       - Avoid null, because null is not typed.
       - MUST: Accept parameters that are set to the default.
       - Optional parameters need not be present and if not present MUST be set to default.
   
   - Relevant part of the spec is [here](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/v1.0/#didwebvh-did-method-parameters).
   
   - Idea:
     - Define default value if not specified in the first applicable entry. Implementations can use that to initialize the setting.
     - Define allowed values if specified. In defining that, note the value to use to "turn off" a parameter.

7. Do we revert an earlier decision and put the witness proofs back into the DID Log? **NO!**
    - Eliminates the separate file/retrieval.
    - Allows "as you go" witnessing of Log Entries.
    - Increases the size of Log Files because witness proofs cannot be "optimized" -- removed when later ones are added.
        - Good to get an estimate on this.
        - Glenn Gore ([Affinidi](https://www.affinidi.com/)) provided us with one -- [Witness Proofs in Logs -- Test Scenario and Analysis](https://hackmd.io/-elL5qKYQgymxLUJxvDggg?view)
        - Based on the analysis, the increase in file size, plus the time to process the additional witness proofs makes the current scheme of separate files better -- we'll keep it.
    - Method -- Add proofs of witnesses to the `proof` item array.
        - I recall we discussed this earlier and decided not to use that approach because "proof sets" was not standardized?
        - Presumably, the proofs in an array have to be over the same content? If so, the witness "payload" for the proof would change to be in the same `proof` item.
